A dynamic and visually engaging thumbnail for a YouTube video about the commit history of a software project. The image should feature a central, stylized code icon (e.g., a brain with circuits or a branching code tree) that represents the evolution of the codebase. Surrounding the central icon, there should be a circular or spiral timeline of smaller icons or abstract shapes, each representing a significant commit. The timeline should progress from a simple, clean state to a more complex and feature-rich one, visually telling the story of the project's development. The color palette should be modern and eye-catching, with a mix of cool blues and greens for the code elements and warm oranges and yellows to highlight key commits or milestones. The title "Code in Motion: A Commit History" should be prominently displayed in a clean, readable font. The overall style should be a blend of futuristic and professional, conveying both the technical nature of the content and its engaging presentation.
