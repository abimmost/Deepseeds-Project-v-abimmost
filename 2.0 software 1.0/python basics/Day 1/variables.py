# thetype='y' #23-int, "wrea"-string, 3.22-float, true/false-boolean

# # snake casing***
# user_name="Shizuka"
# # camel casing
# userNameFrom=""
# # pascal casing
# UserNameFrom=""

# # type(var_name) to get datatype

# whole_number=42
# complex_number=2 + 3j

# one_char='a'
# isTired=True
# notAlive=False
# greeting="Hello, World!"
# print("whole_number is a ", type(whole_number))
# print("greeting is a ", type(one_char), " with value " + one_char)

# ### VARIABLES BASIC EXAMPLES

### AREA AND PERIMETER OF RECTANGLE

# length = float(input("Enter the length: "))
# width = float(input("Enter the width: "))

# area = length * width
# perimeter = 2*(length + width)

# print(f"The area pf the rectangle is {area}.\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is {perimeter}.")

### CELCIUS TO FAHRENHEIT CONVERTER

# celcius = float(input("Enter the temp in celcius:" ))
# fahrenheit = (celcius * 9/5) + 32
# print(f"The temperature {celcius} Celcius is {fahrenheit} Fahrenheit")

# ### ASSIGNMENT: Swap the value of two variables

# print(f"\nLemme confuse you a little... :D\n")
# a=int(input("Enter the value of A: "))
# b=int(input("Enter the value of B: "))
# c=a
# a=b
